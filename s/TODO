  Bug fixes:
        - Find out why generation numbers are one off in graphics and nographics modes.

  Big things:
	- run time editing of the world.
	- add window that shows what some set of agents will do to each other. combat/trade/mate
        - window to show actual species as defined by mating tag/cond.
        - add window showing agents at a site.
        - add random agents?

  Small things:
	- get rid of flickering in graph update.
	- add mutation interarrival time speed up. use for maintenance charging too.
          and for all other such rare things.
	- multiple agent editing.
	- add a color to agent editor?
	- add a remove agent/site/world menu.
	- make sites and agents read and stored as combat array is.

Probables:
	- change widget representation of uptake resource mask.
	- generalize number of chromosomes, make it world-specific
	  and let the world file name the chromosomes too?
	  can the world also specify interactions? (ambitious)
	  this should eventually happen - make it more gassy-like,
	  let the user write interaction functions.

Possibles:
	- make some parameters movable. e.g. make the mutation rate moveable from
	  sites to worlds or even to agents. think of a fast general way to do this
	  (inheritance?). and have it displayed correctly when editing etc.

Dreams:
	- Echo run programming language. Would be nice to have it interpreted.
	  Otherwise have a C program that is compiled and called at the end of
	  each generation & its output captured. A bit horrible but nicer from
	  the compilation/translation aspect.

	  * things that apply to the whole run
	  
	  	stop if {schema X is found,
		   species X level falls below Y
		   species X level rises above Y
		   generation = X
		  }
	  
	  * things to be done sequentially
	  	run X generations
	  	add the following individual
	  	start tracing this schema
	  	turn on/off graphics
