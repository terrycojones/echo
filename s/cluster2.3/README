Compile:
	cc -O -o cluster cluster.c alloc.c -lm

Use:
	cluster [vectors] [names]

where 'vectors' is the file containing vectors to be clustered,
and 'names' is a file containing the name of each vector.

Vectors should be organized one per line, => with a trailing blank before
the carriage return.  Names should be organized similarly; the order
of vectors/names should be the same in both files.

'names' is a sample names file; 'vector' is a sample vector file.  Note that
whereas names must not have any embedded white space, elements in vectors
must be separated by white space.

The program has been enhanced with numerous options to make it more
flexible in interfacing with other applications.  See the the man page for
details.

To generate the program, edit the Makefile according to your preferences
and type `make'.  It is know to compile and run os Sun3 and Sun4 systems
under SunOS 3.5 and 4.1.

Comments and bug fixes requested.

The first release after beta testing (nobody found the glaring bug in the
memory allocation macro ...) has curses support added.

New in release 2.3:

* Eigenvectors are now stored one-per-line, so as to be compatible with
  input/output format.  Old eigenbases will have to recomputed, or the 
  contents of files used with -e can be transposed.
* A new option, -E, allows printing the eigenvalues determined in PCA.
