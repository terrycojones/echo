# This looks for lines in stdin which have the form
# "7 blocks completed after 24000 evaluations"
# and "9 blocks not completed after 56000 evaluations"
# and keeps statistics on the number of times each level
# is reached and how long it took to get there.
# A block is the same as a level, this code uses level everywhere.
#
# The stats are dumped at the end.
