%%%%%%%%%% NEWLY OLD TEXT !

Each world specifies certain system-wide
parameters, including the number of sites, the number of resource
types, the taxation rate, parameters controlling replication, and the
probability of random death.  Each site specifies its own mutation, crossover,
and random death probabilities, as well as some parameters controlling
the details of how resources are managed at the site (e.g., the
maximum amount of a resource that can accumulate at the site).
