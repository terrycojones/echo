THAW foundation??  John Holland conceived of and designed the original
Echo model on which our work is based, and he suggested many of the
ideas in this paper.  James Brown, Marc Feldman, Simon Fraser, Timothy
Keitt, Bruce Milne, and Erik Schultes have all provided many useful
comments on Echo.  Brown suggested the examination of Preston's work
on species abundance. We also thank Josh Epstein, Rob Axtell and all
those involved in Project 2050 at the Santa Fe Institute, the
Brookings Institute and the World Resources Institute for their
