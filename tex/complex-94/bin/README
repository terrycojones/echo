The files in this directory are designed to take the output files from
an Echo run and turn them into files that can be graphed to produce
species curves.

The files are

	cluster-to-species
	graph
*	make-graph
*	make-preston-graph -> make-graph
*	make-sampled-graph -> make-graph
*	make-sampled-preston-graph -> make-graph
	preston
*	process-abundance
	sample
	cluster-cluster


only those with an * are designed to be called by the user.  When an
Echo run is done, the OBJECTS directory will contain files of the form
seed.population and seed.cluster, where seed is some (usually) large
integer. Assume for the purposes of example, that seed = 776503203.

The you should do the following

process-abundance 776503203

This will produce three files: 
    776503203.species
    776503203.genome-abundance
    776503203.genome-by-species. 

The last of these may take a long time to generate (e.g 10 minutes
for a few thousand agents in the final population).

You can then use any of the make-graph variants to view the files. You
can either view the plain population file, or the file where the agents
are grouped by "species" (i.e. the files 776503203.population and
776503203.genome-by-species).

You create the graphs by giving make-graph an even number of
arguments. The odd numbered arguments correspond to names for the
legend, and the even numbered arguments correspond to files of data.
Thus for instance:

make-graph '100 resources' 776503203.by-species

you can give any number of such pairs of arguments.


It is also possible to have the data file sampled before being
graphed. To do this, use make-sampled-graph and provide a sampling
probability as a first argument and pairs of legend and file names
after that as above. E.g.

make-sampled-graph 0.7 '100 resources' 776503203.by-species

which will only pass on 70% of the data lines (on average) to the
graph program.  Each line is selected independently at random with a
0.7 chance.

If you use the 'preston' version of either of these programs, the data
will be grouped into octaves the way Preston did it.


That's it. I think. The other programs you can look at and figure them
out for yourself. After all, you probably wrote them...

P.S. The legend is off in the graphs by default. You can get it on by
     hitting the configure button, choosing Legend and then making
     it mapped. Or you can turn it on in the graph script.
